Philosophy Website

### Overview

Website that will allow people to study and research philosophy. It will also allow users to discuss what they have read, ask questions, and post their own philosophical writings. 
I will be solving a problem that many people run into. Though websites like this one have already been created they usually require restricted access 
(such as being a student or staff member at a university), or they merely contain information about philosophical writings and philosophers rather than the writings themselves (such as wikis, or peer reviewed articles). 
This application will utilize a SQL database to store all the information to create a user friendly and comprehensive library of philosophy.
