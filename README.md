# Philosophy

**Philosophy Website**

### Overview

Website that will allow people to study and research philosophy. It will also allow users to discuss what they have read, ask questions, and post their own philosophical writings. I will be solving a problem that many people run into. Though websites like this one have already been created they usually require restricted access (such as being a student or staff member at a university), or they merely contain information about philosophical writings and philosophers rather than the writings themselves (such as wikis, or peer reviewed articles). This application will utilize a SQL database to store all the information to create a user friendly and comprehensive library of philosophy. 

### Features

* User login - Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each philosopher will have a profile page.
* Easy Research - Users will be able to search the database by philosophical branch, and individuals.
* Make post and comments - Users will be able to create new posts when logged in meant for discussion and philosophical debate. New posts will appear in the philosopher's profile in addition to the discussion sections's main page.
* Upload Files (Update to come...) - Administrators will be able to upload files so that users can view, read, and download philosophy as pdfs. Users will also be able to upload files, such as previously typed papers and articles.
